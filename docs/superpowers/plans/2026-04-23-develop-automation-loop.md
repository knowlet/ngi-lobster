# Develop Loop Progress Plan

> **For agentic workflow:** This plan tracks the recurring development loop constraints when network access is blocked in the automation environment.

**Goal:** Keep local development moving safely when GitHub access is unavailable by resolving available local work, documenting blockers, and preparing the smallest reproducible handoff for the next network-enabled run.

**Tech Stack:** Git, GitHub remote workflow, project plan docs.

**Status:** In progress on local branch `codex/pr21-recut-dispatcher-receipt-guard`.

### Task 1: Remote sync and rebase decision

**Files:** None

- [x] Confirm remote origin URL is configured.
- [x] Attempt `git fetch --prune origin`.
- [x] Record DNS failure (`Could not resolve host: github.com`).
- [ ] Retry fetch when network is available and decide whether to rebase onto latest `main`.

### Task 2: Review PR / Issue / Comment queue

**Files:** None

- [ ] Check for actionable PR comments/issues and apply fixes.
- [ ] Reconcile unresolved review findings before further feature work.
- [ ] Mark this task complete in the next run where GitHub connectivity exists.
- [x] Record review triage is currently blocked because GitHub DNS resolution is failing (`Could not resolve host: github.com`).

### Task 3: Continue implementation and keep documentation updated

**Files:**
- Read: `docs/superpowers/plans/*` and recent `lobster-intel` changes.
- Read: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-23-source-fusion-workspace-tilde.md`
- Read: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-23-source-fusion-home-path-expansion.md`

- [x] Verify prior source-fusion workspace path hardening tests are present and complete.
- [x] Add current automation checkpoint note: no remote review signal available; defer feature changes until connectivity returns.

### Task 4: Commit and prepare sync point

**Files:**
- Add: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-23-develop-automation-loop.md`

- [x] Record current blocker and next step for review/sync in a dedicated progress doc.
- [ ] Push after network restoration and open PR sync to `main` when milestone changes are present.

### Task 5: Remote sync checkpoint

- [x] Re-attempted `git fetch --prune origin` on 2026-04-23 17:46:34+08:00; still blocked by DNS (`Could not resolve host: github.com`).
- [x] Local branch remains `codex/pr21-recut-dispatcher-receipt-guard` ahead of `origin/...` by 2 commits.
